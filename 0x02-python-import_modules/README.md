## Modules in Python

- Modules are .py files that are made of definitions and statements.
- They make it easier to maintain large programs cos instead of writing all definitions in one file, the definitions can be split into smaller files which can be imported. 
- Modules can be imported into other files or into the main file.

## How to import a module
- Modules can be imported using the following lines of code:
1. `import module_name` e.g `import calc`
2. `from module_name import definition` e.g `from calc import add, sub` 
3. `import module_name as alias` e.g `import calc as cl`
4. `from module_name import definition as alias` e.g `from calc import add as a`
